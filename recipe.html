    <h2>Preparation steps:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour,
      granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs,
      milk, and vanilla extract.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry
      ingredients, whisking continuously until you have a smooth batter without
      any lumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a deep fryer
      with about 2 inches of vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 375째F (190째C) over
      medium-high heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> While the oil is heating, prepare a funnel or a
      squeeze bottle with a wide opening. If using a funnel, cover the spout
      with your finger<br />
      to prevent the batter from pouring out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6: </strong>Once the oil has reached the desired temperature,
      carefully pour about 1/2 cup of the batter into the funnel or squeeze
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Position the funnel or squeeze bottle just above
      the hot oil and release the batter, moving in a circular motion to create
      a spiral shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> Fry the funnel cake for about 2-3 minutes on each
      side or until golden brown, using tongs or a slotted spoon to flip it
      halfway through. Cook only one funnel cake<br />
      at a time to ensure even cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong> Once the funnel cake is cooked, remove it from
      the oil and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess
      oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 10:</strong>Repeat the process with the remaining batter,
      adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 11:</strong>Dust the warm funnel cakes generously with
      powdered sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 12:</strong>Serve the funnel cakes immediately while still
      warm and enjoy!

      (around 375째F or 190째C) before frying the funnel cakes.<br />
      If the oil is too hot, the cakes may brown too quickly on the outside

      <strong>Tip 2:</strong>: If using a funnel, make sure to cover the spout
      with your finger between pours to prevent the batter from flowing out.
