**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this recipe webpage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any technology you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Instructions
1. Create a new HTML file named "recipe.html" using your visual studio code editor.

2. Set up the basic structure of the HTML document using the appropriate tags.

3. Inside the <head> section, include a <title> tag with the title "My Favorite Recipe."

4. Inside the <body> section, create the following components:
    a. Add a heading with the recipe title using an appropriate heading tag.
